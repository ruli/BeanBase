BeanBase
========

A way to start using RedBean PHP ORM

Components
========

* A Base Model (Models\BaseModel): Aims to be a very generic model to be extended.

* An Utility Class (Utils\RBB)
  * Soft create and update, and read.
  * Associate method handling simple ONE-TO-ONE, ONE-TO-MANY, MANY-TO-MANY, and MANY-TO-ONE (reversed ONE-TO-MANY)

Others
========

License, documentation and all other stuff will be available as soon as I get Unit Tests done along with detailed usage example.

However, don't worry about license, it's going to be one of those "please use at your own risk, for free" licenses.
