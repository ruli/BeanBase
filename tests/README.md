Tests
=====

> Notice: although the test suite comes with an rb.php, it does not mean that you should thoroughly rely on this version of RedBean.
> The better place to grab it is still at [RedBean Official Site](http://redbeanphp.com)

The tests are written in [SimpleTest framework](http://www.simpletest.org/).
